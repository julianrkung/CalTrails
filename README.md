CALTRAILS

This project was created with 3 of my classmates (Ethan, Danlin, and Haoran) during SodaHacks in April of 2018. The entire project took 18 hours.


Caltrails is a Berkeley themed, oregon-trails-esque game with three playable characters.

It was made using JavaScript and the createJS library and includes features such as that dynamic sprites, background images created through singular value decomposition (learned in linear algebra class), and random events that occur during the player's 8 semester tenure at the university.
